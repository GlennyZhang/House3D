# Rendering code of House3D

We provided the [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) to simplify the build process on Linux + Nvidia GPUs.
Follow the instructions below if you want to build by your own.


## Build

Build depends gcc >= 4.9 or clang. Check [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) to install the dependencies.
Then:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
# make sure your environment variables don't include paths you don't need

# linux/macos, system python (or homebrew python on macos):
make
# or PYTHON_CONFIG=python3-config make
# or PYTHON_CONFIG=python2-config make
# depend on the version of python you want to use

# linux, anaconda:
SYSTEM=conda.linux PYTHON_CONFIG=/path/to/anaconda/bin/python3-config make

# macos, anaconda (upgrade anaconda if you see any compilation issues):
SYSTEM=conda.macos PYTHON_CONFIG=/path/to/anaconda/bin/python3-config make
# If using anaconda, you also need to add /path/to/anaconda/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running the renderer
```

## Use

C++:
```
./test-rectangle.bin [egl/headless/glfw]		# a small tool to verify that rendering works
./objview.bin xx.obj	# viewer (require a display to show images)
./objview-suncg.bin xx.obj ModelCategoryMapping.csv	 colormap_coarse.csv  # viewer in SUNCG mode
./objview-offline.bin xx.obj # render without display (to test its availability on server)
```

Python:
```
cd /path/to/House3DRepo/tests
export PYTHONPATH=..
python test-rendering.py /path/to/suncg/house/house.obj
```
Check `test-rendering.py` for the API usage. Read docstrings in 
[suncg/render.hh](https://github.com/facebookresearch/House3D/blob/master/renderer/suncg/render.hh) 
for detailed explanation on the APIs.

Example data can be found at [releases](https://github.com/facebookresearch/House3D/releases/tag/example-data).

## Choosing the Rendering Backend:

Certain executables (e.g. `objview.bin`) use on-screen rendering, which requires
a screen/display to show the images.
`objview-offline.bin` and the Python API all use off-screen rendering, and has
the following two options on Linux:

1. When the environment variable "DISPLAY" exists, the variable is used to
   connect to an X11 server, and the __GLX rendering backend__ will be used. Note that:

   + This method does not require a discrete GPU.
     + If the X11 server is connected to a discrete or integrated GPU, the GPU
       will be used. On machines with >1 GPUs, it can only use the one connected to the X11 server.
     + If not (e.g. xvfb, vnc), software rendering (mesa) will be used with a
       very low framerate.
   + Certain types of X session (e.g. a ssh-forwarded X session, a VNC session) may not
     support the necessary render features needed.
     If you are under a SSH session with X forwarding, make sure to
     `unset DISPLAY` to disable the GLX backend.

2. Otherwise, it will use the __EGL rendering backend__, which requires a decent Nvidia GPU.
   It also has the option to choose which GPU to use, therefore you can run
   multiple rendering instances on __multiple GPUs__.

On Mac, it will always use the CGL backend.

## Speed:

Use the following script to benchmark:
```
python benchmark-rendering-multiprocess.py /path/to/suncg/house/house.obj --num-proc 5 --num-gpu 1
```
The command prints per-process framerate.
The total framerate should reach __1.5k ~ 2.5k frames per second__ on a decent Nvidia GPU.
It also scales well to multiple GPUs if used with the EGL backend.


## Trouble Shooting

Please tell us the following if you encounter any build issues or the code fails to run:

1. Your environment (hardware, OS, driver version), and how you build.
2. `cd` to `renderer/` directory and run `./debug-build.sh`. Include the results in your issues.
3. If you've successfully built some binaries, please include the output of the
   two commands: `./test-rectangle.bin egl`, `./test-rectangle.bin headless`.
4. Tell us what you observed by pasting them in full, not by describing them in abstract.


### Common Issues:
1. `Assertion "glGetString(GL_VERSION)" FAILED`: try building with libglvnd as mentioned above.
2. `undefined symbol: _ZTVNSt7__cxx1119basic_ostringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` C++ ABI incompatibility.
3. "dynamic module does not define init function": compile-time and run-time python version does not match.
4. X server error: don't ssh with X forwarding. Make sure there is no "DISPLAY" environment variable.
5. "Framebuffer is not complete!": `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` incorrectly set, causing
   the binary to load a different OpenGL library at run time.
6. "Framebuffer is not complete" after opening many instances of renderer: there seems to be a hard limit, depending on the hardwares,
	on the number of rendering context you can use.
7. "[EGL] Detected 0 devices" or "Failed to get function pointer of eglQueryDevicesEXT": EGL not functioning. There could be multiple reasons:
   + Not linking against `libEGL.so` provided by nvidia driver.
   + GPU or driver does not support EGL.
   + Running inside container (e.g. docker) with an old driver may also result
     in such error.
